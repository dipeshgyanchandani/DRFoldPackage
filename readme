1. What is DRfold?
    DRfold (Deep RNA fold) is a program for RNA tertiary structure prediction based on deep learning potentials. 

2. How to install the DRfold?
    1) Third-party softwares
		1. PETfold (https://rth.dk/resources/petfold/download.html)
		2. The ViennaRNA Package (https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/)

    1) Prerequisites
        1. Python3 with numpy and scipy 
        2. pytorch (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
           Anaconda is recommended to set up python environments

    2) Localization 
		1. Modify DRfold/scripts/Features.py to set 'petfoldbin' and 'ViennaRNAbin' properly, according to
			your own installation.
		2. Modify the PETFOLDBIN path in DRfold/DRfold.sh (Line 6)
		3. Modify the PYTHON path in DRfold/DRfold.sh (Line 7)
		4. Set executable permission to the bin file in DRfold/bin/.

3. Bug report:
    Please visit https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/bbs/?q=forum/2

4. How to run the DRfold?
	python DRfold.sh [fastafile] [outputdir]
		fastafile: The input fastafile containing the query sequence
		outputdir:  Output file dir

5. Example
	You can test by fowllowing commands:
		' bash DRfold.sh test/seq.fasta test/DRfold_out '
	It will generate several files:
		' DPR.pdb ': is the final results of DRfold
		Other by-products:
		' DPR_{0~5}.pdb '       : raw structures from 6 end-to-end models (numbers are not related to the rankings) 
		' geo.npy '				: averaged geometry predictions from 3 geometry models, can be accessed by "np.load('geo.npy',allow_pickle=True).item()"
